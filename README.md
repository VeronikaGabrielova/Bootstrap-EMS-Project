# Bootstrap-EMS-Project
EMS is a Bootstrap project that showcases employee data using tables. This is my first Bootstrap project, and I have created tables that display employee names and their respective job positions. The project aims to provide a clear and concise overview of employee data and demonstrates my ability to use Bootstrap to create responsive and visually appealing web pages.
